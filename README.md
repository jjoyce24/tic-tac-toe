### The Approach Taken
I first started with wireframes to get a general idea of what I wanted the interface to look like and what buttons and inputs shouild do.

Second part was attempting to replicate the wireframe with HTML and CSS. Could not quite get it to look the way I wanted, but had all the needed HTML elements to start working with jQuery.

Third part was working with jQuery and used a fair share of if/else statements. Started with .click on all of the button elements to have them change to x or o. After that I set each buttons text to a variable and used the variables in a long list of if/else statements in order to pick a winner. Then I created variables to hold player scores, which I impemented into the if/else statements. After getting user score counts I finished off with a scoreboard that would use the playerscore variables. Then I found a way to create a function that would reload the page and created a button that would execute the function and restart the game.

### Unsolved Problems
DRY DRY DRY. I wanted to use arrays and for loops to cut down on the if/else statements.
